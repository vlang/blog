V uses C as the primary backend. 

Many people find this choice strange, and one of the most common comments/suggestions is "Why not use LLVM?"

1. Using a C backend is a completely valid strategy (for example, the first C++ compiler Cfront did exactly this). C can be viewed as a modern cross-platform assembly language.
To the end-user, it doesn't really matter what intermediate step is used to generate their binary, as long as it works, and the performance is good. 

2. **Easy bootstrapping and development.** To bootstrap V, you need to download `v.c` and run `cc v.c`. That's it. No dependencies, no bootstrapping chains, nothing. The developers of the language don't need to work on two parallel implementations, new features can be introduced and used in the language right away. V has been 100% written in V since the release.

3. C gives us **amazing platform support.** C runs on everything, literally everything. LLVM supports lots of platforms and architectures, but it will never beat C. Being able to run V software on everything that C supports is huge.

4. **Great tooling.** Warnings, static analyzers, Valgrind, etc help to ensure that everything is correct. Writing programs that pass `-Wall -pedantic`, Clang analyzer, PVS, and result in zero Valgrind warnings/errors is a dream of any C/C++ developer. With V it's going to be guaranteed for every V program. (We are not there yet, but very close.)

5. **Stability.** New languages using LLVM directly are going to crash often. That's inevitable, and can be seen across all new languages using LLVM. Major C compilers like Clang/GCC/MSVC are very stable and are highly unlikely to result in crashes when compiling C code generated by V. The V compiler hasn't crashed once for me, and I haven't received any crash reports from other users.

6. **Simplicity.** LLVM is a huge C++ dependency, meaning that both developers of the language and the users are forced to install it. Calling C++ is not easy from V/C, so C wrappers have to be used, increasing the number of dependencies and complexities.

There is one clear drawback: you are limited by the capabilities of C. So far I've only faced some minor annoyances that could be easily overcome. Luckily V is a very small and simple language close to C.

By the time of the 1.0 release, V will also have direct x64 machine code generation (similar to TCC), but the C backend will always be available, for production builds and for all supported platforms.

With all that said, I'm open to an alternative LLVM backend. It's good to have multiple implementations.
